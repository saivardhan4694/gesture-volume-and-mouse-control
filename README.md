## Hand Gesture Control Module
# Overview
This project implements a hand gesture recognition system using the MediaPipe Hands model. It allows users to control system functions such as volume and mouse movements using hand gestures. The system is designed for gesture-based voice control and gesture-based mouse control.

# Key Features:
Volume Control: Adjust the volume based on the distance between the thumb and index finger. As the distance increases, the volume increases proportionally.
Virtual Mouse:
Move the mouse pointer by raising only the index finger and moving your hand.
Perform a right-click by raising both the index and middle fingers simultaneously.

# Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

Install the required packages:

python hand_gesture_control.py

# Usage
Make sure your webcam is connected.
The program will automatically detect your hand gestures and control the volume or mouse accordingly.

# Gesture Controls:
Volume Control: Adjust by varying the distance between your thumb and index finger.
Mouse Control: Move the pointer with the index finger raised; perform a right-click by raising the middle finger.
